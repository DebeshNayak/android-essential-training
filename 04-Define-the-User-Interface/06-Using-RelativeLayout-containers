Using RelativeLayout Containers:
- The RelativeLayout container is the other most commonly used view group. It lets
  you anchor objects to a container's edges or to other objects within the container.
- RelativeLayout container allows you to place and size objects by anchoring the objects either to
  the container or to other objects within the container.
- It's typically more adaptable than the linear layout containers
Example: 03-RelativeLayout project
