Display messages with Toast and Snackbar:
- The Android SDK gives you a couple of ways of displaying messages to the user.
- We've already seen one of these types of messages in action, the Snackbar message.
----------------
- A Toast message is managed by the application framework, not directly by the application UI.

Example: 06-UserMessages project
