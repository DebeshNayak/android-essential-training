Create multiple versions of images:
- There are ways of creating alternative images both for the launcher icon and for icons
  that you use in the Action bar.
- In both cases, folders were created under resources for the different pixel density buckets.
- And it's up to the application framework to decide which version of a PNG or JPG file to use
  at runtime depending on the device's capabilities.
- You can do the same thing with other kinds of images, but Android Studio won't handle it for you.
- If you try to create a new image asset in Android Studio, you'll see that there are options for
  three different kinds of asset types, but they're all icons.
- None of them are simple images.
- So if you want to generate different size images for different screens, you'll need another tool.
