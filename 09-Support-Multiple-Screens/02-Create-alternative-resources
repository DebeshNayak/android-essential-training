Create alternative resources:
- There are a number of ways to make an app adapt to different screen sizes, pixel densities, and orientations.
- If you take any resource directory name such as layout or values, and you append -land,
  the files or the values that are defined in the landscape version of the directory will override
  the default values or files.
- And you can look at the documentation for lots of examples of this that are supported by the Android application framework.

Example: 19-AlternativeLayout project
