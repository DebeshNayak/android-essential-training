Displaying menu items in the Action Bar:
- By default, menu items appear on the Options menu, but you can also cause them
  to appear in Action Bar area.
- That's the bar at the top of the app. Here's how you can do this in XML
--------
- Instead of using the "android" prefix, I'll use the "app" prefix in the "showAsAction" attribute.
  Here's why we're doing this. In the MainActivity class, as the app starts up, there's code in place
  that's replacing the actual Action Bar with an object called the Toolbar, and the toolbar class is
  a class from the support library.
- The general rule is that any attributes that are defined in the core Android SDK libraries have the prefix android.
- But there are times where attributes of objects that are defined in the support libraries use the app prefix.
