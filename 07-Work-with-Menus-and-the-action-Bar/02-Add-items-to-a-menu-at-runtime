Add items to a menu at runtime:
- You can add menu items dynamically using Java code.
- We need a menu ID.
- When we define a menu in in XML, the menu item ID it's assigned is part of the
  item element.
- The actual integer value of this ID is assigned dynamically when the code is
  generated.
- When you create your own menu items, you'll have to create your own unique ID,
- But it shouldn't be an integer.
------------
- So you can create your menus as a combination of static XML and dynamic Java
  code, but when you handle the menu selection, typically all that code will go
  into this same method, so you know exactly where all the menu handling code is.
