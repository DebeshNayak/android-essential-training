Define the options menu with XML:
- When you first create an app using the templates in Android studio, the app will
  have an options menu.
- When you touch the icon in the upper right corner you see the menu pop up and if
  there are more items than one it will drop down from that corner.
- You can then select an item and it will result in calling a bit of Java code.
- I'm going to show you how to define more items on that menu and then give you some
  variations for how to handle the events that are dispatched when the user selects items
  from the menu.
------------------
- The "onCreateOptionsMenu" method is called automatically as the activity starts up.
- So, you can put in some conditional code and decide which version of a menu you prefer
  to use in a particular situation.
- All of your menu information can be defined in ".xml" files, and then you handle the
menu events in Java code.
