Create new activities and layouts:
- My simple demonstration app has only a single screen or activity.
- But most Android apps will have more than one activity so I'll show you how to
  create a new activity and then show you where it's registered in your application manifest
  and how it's structured.
--------------------
To create new activity:
1. File -> New -> Activity -> Blank Activity
--------------------
- the setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled() on older versions of Android calling this method
  will cause an icon to appear on your action bar.
- An up button. It's actually an arrow pointing to the left but it's one more way
  for the user to return from the current activity to the parent activity.
--------------------
Example: 18-AddActivity project
