Open other apps with implicit intents:
There are two type of intents:
1. Explicit intent to navigate from one activity to another within a single application.
2. Implicit intents allow you to share data with other applications on the same Android device.
- Here we will do two types of implicit intents:
1. One to jump to a website, and
2. Other to send an email, both from within my sample application.
----------------
1. One to jump to a website
webIntent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager())
- This line of code check if there is an app that can handle the URI and if it is not then it will return null.
----------------
2. Send Email:
----------------
- We can do similar things for Google Maps and many other apps that are installed
  on an Android device.
- For more information about implicit intents, and in particular, look at the constants
  that are available from the Intent class for common actions.
