Use dependencies and support libraries:
- Android Studio's dependency system is based on an architecture known as Maven.
- A Maven repository is a library of libraries, a place where developers can add
  libraries, and other developers can download them.
- In the file build.gradle file inside the "dependencies" block, the support libraries
  are defined.
  Example:
  - The "appcompart" library gives features that will work all the way back to API level 7
  - The "design" library includes components such as floating action button, that let you
    create compelling visual display in the app.
- In order to use this feature we must have installed something called "Support Repository"
  Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager -> SDK Tools -> Android Support Repository
- To include a new dependency:
  - File -> Project Structure -> app Module -> Dependencies -> Click the '+' button
- So the idea is that you don't have to go get a JAR file, a Java library, and add it to your
  projects folders, and then go through all the work of adding that library, or JAR file, to your class path.
  - Instead, simply list the library and the version you want in your dependencies in your build.gradle file,
  and all the work is done for you.
--------------
- The build.gradle project type file's jcenter() method looks for the bintray.com website for the
  requested dependencies list.
- But if you learn a little bit more about how dependencies work, you can actually add your own
  repositories to this list and expand the capabilities of the gradle.build system.
