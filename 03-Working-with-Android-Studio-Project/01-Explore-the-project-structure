Android Project Folder Structure:
app: this folder is known as module
  - Under that one named "src" folder
    - Under that one named "main"
      - Inside this folder we can find "java" classes
        - And inside it we will find all the java "package" folder and this package
          represent the "app id"
          - And inside it the "MainActivity" class
        - The main java package is registered in "AndroidManifest.xml" file and "build.gradle" file
      - And "res" folder
        - This contain all of the resource folder
        - Inside it following sub-folders are present:
          1. "drawable", and it contain .png and .jpg files to represent graphics in the app.
          2. "layout", has xml files that describe how your screen looks like
            - This initially contain 2 XML file
              1. activity_main.xml: It serves as container for the whole screen description.
              2. content_main.xml:
                - This file is included inside the activity_main file.
                - This file has it's own description regarding user interface element
          3. "menu", which has xml file which contains menu in the app.
          4. "mipmap", which contain a .png file which a launcher graphic.
            - These folder are labeled with "dpi" label, DPI represents pixel density
            - The devices with higher pixel density have might have pixel density of "xxxhdpi"
            - The devices with lower pixel density have might have pixel density of "hdpi"
            - At runtime the app framework select appropriate version of a .png file to display for current device.
          5. "values", which contain following XML file:
            - strings.xml - describes strings and gives them identities
                          - using string resources like this makes it possible to localize app for different languages
          6. "value" folder with suffix, like
            - "values-v21" will run on devices which have API level 21 or later
            - "values-w820p" will run on a device at least one side of screen with a width of at least 820 device independent pixel
- Most of the time while working on Android Studio, we have to work on "Android" view
- The purpose of Android view is to make it faster and easier to do Android development
