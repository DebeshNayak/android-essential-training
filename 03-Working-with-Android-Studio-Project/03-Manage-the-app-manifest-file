Manage the app manifest file:
- The AndroidManifest file is an XML file that describes the app to the operating system and virtual machine.
- The file name is AndroidManifest.xml
- This file will be find inside "manifests" folder in the "Android" view.
------------
- Root element of this XML is "manifest"
- And the child element is "application"
- The manifest element starts with a namespace declaration with a prefix of android.
- That prefix is then used throughout the Application Manifest file.
- The package  attribute of the root element points to the app's default package.
-----------
- The application element controls the aspect of the application.
- Following are the attribute of the application element:
      allowBackup: determines whether app's data will be backed up to Google.
      icon: control the graphical element that's displayed on a device's launcher screen
      label: App's label
      supportsRtl: whether support right to left text rendering
      theme: theme of the entire project, controlling the application's appearance.
- The child element of the "application" is "activity" element
  - An "activity" represent a screen.
  - Following are some of the attribute of the "activity" element
    name: Represents a Java class that determines that screen's behavior.
    label: Override the label of the app
    theme: Override the theme of the app
  - The child element of the "activity" element is "intent-filter"
    - It determine when this activity is brought to the screen.
    - An activity with an intent-filter that has an action of MAIN and a category
      of LAUNCHER is the application's launcher activity.
- We can configure the permissions in the manifest file.
  - This will be place as the child of the root element.
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE"/>

Reformat the code shortcut:
Mac: cmd + opt + l
Win: ctrl + alt + l
----------
  - But apps that run on devices with Android 6 Marshmallow can defer permission requests
    until the user tries to do something that needs that permission.
    - For example, an app might need to write data to the device's calendar that needs a
      special permission, but the user won't be asked for that permission until the app tries
      to do it.
  - The "AndroidManifest" file is where we can define about activities and control app's behaviors
    and appearance,
  - And it is where you can grant permissions that allow your application to execute
    critical functions.
