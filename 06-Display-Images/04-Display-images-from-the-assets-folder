Display images from the assets folder:
- We have studied 3 different ways of displaying an image using the ImageView control.
- We can do everything in the layout file using a fixed image resource, or we can point to
  a fixed image resource in Java code or it could be done dynamically, starting from a string,
  and getting the resource from the string.
- There is another way, not using a resource, but using something called an "asset" file.
- Asset files are placed in the assets folder, and unlike resource, they aren't
  compiled into the application in any way, and resource identifiers aren't assigned.
- Instead we address an asset file using its real name and not anything that goes through a Java class.
--------------
So we can choose between working with resources or assets:
- When we are working with a single image, we keep everything in the resources folder,
- But when we are working with multiple images, to run the application faster, we need to
  work with assets and open those images dynamically from the assets folder.
