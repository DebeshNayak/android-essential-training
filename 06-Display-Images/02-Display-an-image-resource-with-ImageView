Display an image resource with ImageView:
- We can also use these graphics within your app to brand your application.
- <ImageView> element is used to add a image resource.
- Image resources are great when you already know what the image is going to be.
To add a Image into the app:
1. You place the image inside the drawable folder.
2. Then reference the image through its resource identifier.
3. Then set the image dimensions with dps, not with physical pixels, to make sure
  that the image modifies itself for each unique device.
4. Then take these dp settings and save them as dimension resources.
So, I can make it very easy to override them later on with other settings.
  - Select the text
  - Press Alt + enter
  - Select "Extract dimension resource"
