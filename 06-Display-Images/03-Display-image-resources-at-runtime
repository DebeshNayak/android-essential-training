Display image resources at runtime:
- We can display an image from an ImageResource with Java code.
- There is two ways of displaying image resources in Java code.
1. Using setImageResource():
ImageView iv = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.photo);
iv.setImageResource(R.drawable.jacket101);

2. getResources().getIdentifier():
ImageView iv = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.photo);

String imageName = "jacket101";
int res = getResources().getIdentifier(imageName, "drawable", getPackageName());
iv.setImageResource(res);

- This coding style is useful when you're working with a single image and
  you're starting with a String value, say a value that's stored in a database.
- But there are certain circumstances, especially when you're scrolling a list of values,
  where this bit of code is entirely too slow.
- There is another approach available working with images not as Resources, but as something called "Assets".
