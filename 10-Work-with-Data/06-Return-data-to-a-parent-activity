Return data to a parent activity:
- When working with two activities, you can return data from the second activity
  by packaging the data as intent extras.
- As with the data you're sending, you'll need a constant for each extra that's
  accessible to both the sender and the receiver that's used as the extra name,
  and identifies that value.
---------------------
So these are the four steps:
1. Create the intent object,
2. Use it to package up your data,
3. You could add more than one extra in if you wanted
4. Set result and connect the data to the result
5. Then call finish to close the current activity and return to the parent.
---------------------
- I check to make sure that I'm coming back from the DetailActivity, that everything's okay.
- Then I extract my message string from the intent bundle.
- Then I create a Snackbar message and display it,
- But also allow the user to jump to another action by adding an action to the Snackbar message.
--------------------
- Intents can be used to package the data going in both directions.
