Create and open a detail activity:
-----------------------------
- When a user touches an item on a list, they expect to see the details of the selected item.
- There are a few ways to do this in Android, but the simplest is to navigate to another
  activity known as the DetailActivity and display the details there.
- In order to see the details, I'll create the new activity and then I'll add code
  to navigate to that activity.
----------------
Following code will be added to the MainActivity class:
// add code to handle onItemClickListener()
// we are using setOnItemClickListener() to handle click event of every item in the list
lv.setOnItemClickListener(new AdapterView.OnItemClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onItemClick(AdapterView<?> adapterView, View view, int i, long l) {
        Intent intent = new Intent(MainActivity.this, DetailActivity.class);
        startActivity(intent);
    }
});
-----------------
Example: 26-DetailActivity
