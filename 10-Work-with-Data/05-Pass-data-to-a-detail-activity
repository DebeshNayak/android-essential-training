Pass data to a detail activity:
- When navigating from one activity to another, you can pass data as an extra.
- An extra can be of one of the common Java data types, strings, numbers and Booleans,
  and you can also pass arrays of those types.
- And you can even pass collections of name-value pairs known as bundles, a kind of HashMap.
------------------------
- Here, I'll pass a single value from my main activity to my detail activity,
- And then in the detail activity, I'll use that value to get a complex object from my data provider.
- And from there, I'll be able to display all of the requested details.
------------------------
- We have to use extras.
- And we could either pass a whole bunch of extra values, or, as I did,
  you can pass a single primary key value and then use that value in the receiving
  or detail activity to go get the data you need.
