Handle View event with Java code:
- We can also do all of our event handling in pure Java.
-----------------
- To do this we have to do the following steps:
(Note: Here no need to add any attribute to any XML element)
  1. Create a reference to the Button.
Button button = findViewById(R.id.submitButton);
  2. Then we call the method of the button object
button.setOnClickListener();
  - This requires an instance of an interface named onClickListener.
  - It's upto us to define implementation of the interface and implement
    it's required methods.
  - Here this is done using an anonymous class with new OnClickListener.
  - When selecting the OnClickListener(), it will automatically add override for the interface's onClick():
    public void onClick(View v){

    }
  - The onClick() receives a single argument, a reference to the View object that dispatched the event.
-------------------
  - So how you handle events is completely up to you:
    1. You can either use the method where you register an event handler in a layout
      file and then call a method in a Java class,
    2. You can set up the entire event handler in Java by creating a anonymous implementations of event handler interfaces.
