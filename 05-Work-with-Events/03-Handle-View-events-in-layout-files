Handle View events in layout files:
- Each visual control in a layout is a view, and views can dispatch events.
- You can handle events either through code that you add into both
  - the Java class and a layout file,
  - or through just the Java class itself.
----------------
1. add the following attribute to the XML element:
android:onClick="buttonClickHandler"
2. On that same like press "Alt+Enter"
3. Select the "Create onClick EventHandler"
4. Select the Java class where to add that method.
And it will create the following method:
public void buttonClickHndler(View view){

}
  - This method receives a single argument, a reference to a view.
  - That view is the object that dispatches the event.
-------------------
We have done the following steps:
- We start in the layout file.
- Then we registered the event in the appropriate element using the name of the
  event as an XML attribute.
- Then we created our method name and generate the method skeleton in the Java class.
- Then added the implementation of the method to react to the event.
