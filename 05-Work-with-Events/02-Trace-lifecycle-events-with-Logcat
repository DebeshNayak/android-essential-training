Trace lifecycle events with Logcat:
- Android is an event-oriented programming environment.
- You typically execute Java code in reaction to events that are dispatched as a
  result of user actions or by the operating system or app framework.
- To trace these events in your code, and see what's going on the device and in your apps,
  we use a tool called logcat that's built into the Android SDK and integrated into Android Studio.
